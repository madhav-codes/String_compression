# String_compression
This project shows C++ illustration of compression of string. It uses Huffman Coding algorithm.Huffman algorithm is a Lossless compression algorithm which performs effectively when frequency of similar characters are high i.e., it is entropy based data compression technique.Besides this project also uses Hashmap, Tree and PriorityQueue data structures for various purposes.
